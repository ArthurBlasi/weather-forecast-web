# weather-forecast-web

A web project using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that focused on integrating external APIs.
The main challenge was fetching and displaying data dynamically while ensuring a responsive user interface.
JavaScript's `fetch()` and `async/await` played a key role in handling asynchronous API requests.
CSS was used to create a clean, responsive design, and HTML provided the structure.
This project improved my skills in working with web APIs and building interactive applications.
